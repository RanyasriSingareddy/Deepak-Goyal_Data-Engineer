the headaches of updating the operating system and development tools or maintaining hardware.

ADF is used to create data pipelines.
Airflow and AWS glue are also used to create data pipelines
In Airflow, it is open source(not proprietary of Azure or AWS) and python code has to be written for creating pipelines

- ADF is used to create data pipelines..we create a workflow through which we move data
- It is also called as Orchestration tool(it's like an ETL tool)
- Old ETL tools  -> SSIS, Informatica,IBMs Page
- OLTP Database - Online Transactional DB. we want fast read and write with small size of data
- Ex of OLTP - MySQL, SQL Server, PostGre, IBM DB2, Oracle
- OLAP - Online Analyis Processing - BI/Data Analyst has to do some analysis and that will be on historical data. They have to process huge amount of data. Hence a big data base is created for it and it's known as 
Dataware house. 
- Process through which data is moved from OLTP to OLAP is ETL and it can be synced on timely basis 
- DE has to perform ETL process...They may extract data from SQL server(on-prem) or Rest API
or CSV or JSON file or SFTP or FTP server or Salesforce DB or Dynamic 365 etc and do some transformation
and load it to Cloud which is nothing but to Data lake
