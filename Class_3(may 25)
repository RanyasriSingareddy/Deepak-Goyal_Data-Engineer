Azure Data Lake Storage --It is azure storage service here we can dump all files similar to BLOB with fe differences
To create Aure Data Lake storage :
All steps are similar to blob storage..one step makes difference (Enable hierarical namespace)
We can modify BLOB to ADLS as well , in prop just enable hierarical namespace
Hierarical namespace is complemented by Data Lake Storage Gen2 endpoint enables file and directory semantics, accelerates big data analytics workloads and enables access control lists(ACLs)

Data stored in ADLS is used to perform analysis of big data fast compared to BLOB..So if data has to be used for analytics, then it should be on ADLS
Once ADLS account is created, we have to create container and then files can be uploaded into container
In Blob, we don't have an option to create directory in container whereas in ADLS , we have "create directory" option..same like file explorer, we can create folders->sub-folders

In most companies, DE is not the one who creates storage accounts, admins should do it
----------------------------
If any application has to connect with storage account, then authorization/authencation can be done in two ways
- Access keys  ( it is available under security+networking) --> we have to provide storage acc name and access key. It gives full access(Read, write, delete etc) so it's not recomended to give access keys.
There are two keys(Key1 and Key2)
Ex: if Java/python code has to connect with storage account, then we give storage acc and access key..they put in connection string section
- SAS token(Shared Access Signature) : ( it is available under security+networking) - Unlike Access key, we can define and limit access with it
After selecting the required options, click on generate SAS token.Once token is create,we can provide it for connecting any app with storage acc
In real time, DE will not have access to generate or view access key or SAS tokens. It's again with admin for security concern
If incase, DE want access key values, it will be stored through key vault by admins
------------------------------------
If access has to be provided to some external resource like someone from other project to the ADLS , then it will be done through IAM. we can give according to the role
--------------------------------------
Different types of storage services
1. File Share service -- This can be used for sharing files..something like map drive in File explorer.. Protocol used in File share service is SMB protocol. Port which it access is 445
(Normal BLOB or ADLS uses http protocol)
To access file share, our machine shouldn't have firewall which restricts port 445..For this, deepak has create a VM.
To access file share drive created in azure, we have to map it to drive similar to fildrop..while creating a mapping network, in Folder - we have to File share path from azure portal ( under storage account - file share service, click on
connect--> Show script - Take fileshare link) then it asks for creds..Go to Access keys - username will be storage acc name and pw will be key..copy it and paste.
Now whatever is uploaded in Fileshare, it can be viewed in VM's netork drive
